## Sample sales report

This report sumarizes the sales data for different types of vehicles sold between 2003 and 2005. This data is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data).


### Sales by type

The total number of **planes** sold was `r sales_counts$n[3]`

The total number of **motorcycles** sold was `r sales_counts$n[2]`

The total number of **classic cars** sold was `r sales_counts$n[1]`.

```{r}
#Simple bar chart that represents the sales data 
ggplot(data = sales_counts, 
       mapping = aes(x = PRODUCTLINE,
                     y = n,
                     fill = PRODUCTLINE)) +
      geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
      labs(x = "Type of vehicle",
           y = "Number of sales",
           title = "Sales of Vehicle Type",
           subtitle = "2003 - 2005")
```
